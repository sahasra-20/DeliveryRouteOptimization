Delivery Route Optimization


This project aims at optimising the travel time of all the delivery agents in a city.
Each depot is assigned to a delivery agent. The orders are clustered together using kmeans clustering. 
After orders are assigned to delivery agents. We find the most optimal route. This is calculated based on time.
Traffic is considered. We calculate the traffic parameter based on gradient descent.
To optimise the route, we use the Bellman Held Karp algorithm. 

Required installments - numpy, networkx , matplotlib
